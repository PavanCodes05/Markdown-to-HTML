# Static Site Generator

1. Features:
   - It should handle multiple markdown files at once
   - Parse all md files into one new directory in the user's current folder as HTML files
   - I Do not want to style css for v1
   - v1 doesn't support any custom layouts/templates
2. Libraries or tools:
   - There are lot of built-in and external libraries, but I do plan to keep this as much vannila code as possible
   - Just taking note of availble resources for maybe v2, `markdown` or `mistune` libraries that could help me in v2

### Simple workflow (V1)

1. Read the input markdown files
2. Parse the markdown into HTML files
3. Apply a template or add basic stylinh
4. Save the output HTML files in the desired directory
